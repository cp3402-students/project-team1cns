# Development and Deployment Workflow

## CMS - Wordpress
The content management system that has been used is Wordpress due to its scalability (as this website will be constantly expanding), its user friendly design (so that the site can be maintained by volunteers with basic technology knowledge) and its extensive library of available logins

 ## Version Control - Github
 GitHub was utilised for version control, with several branches such as Main, Staging, and Development.

Here's how a team member could contribute changes:

### Create a New Branch:

* Create a new branch in the GitHub repository with an appropriate name - ensure its a branch that is separate from the main

### Commit Changes:

* Make the desired changes to the code within this branch created above and regularly commit these changes with descriptive messages to track the work completed. 

### Propose Merge with Development Branch:

* Once changes are completed and tested locally, a pull request can be opened to propose the merging of the created branch with the main development branch

### Review Process:

* Once the pull request is proposed, other members of the team review these changes, providing feedback and improvements if required
* If feedback is provided, this is to be addressed by making necessary adjustments 

### Merge Approval:

* Once the changes have been addressed and the team has agreed that the work is ready for the main developlement branch, the pull request will be approved for merging. 

### Merge Changes:

* The branch is then merged into the development branch, which incorporates this newly created code in the main development
