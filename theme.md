# Theme - Continuing Development

## Features

## Design

### Colours

Colours can be changed and added to under variable-site/_colours.scss. We went with the naming convention of "name of colour" + _ + "colour". By making colour an independent Sass variable it allows for change to happen across the site based where the variables have been used. 

### Typography

Typography seen within the site can be changed under variable-site/_typography.scss. The naming convention for font variables was set to "font name" + _ + "font". This allows for modular font design and allowing our website to follow DRY principles.
